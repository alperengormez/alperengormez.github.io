In this post, I will talk about my preparation for my second marathon and share some visual data on the results of heart rate training.

I ran my first marathon in May 2023 with a time of 4 hours and 56 minutes. Finishing a marathon is not a simple feat, but still I felt upset with the outcome. I think I was too ambitious about my goal of 3 hours and 30 minutes, and too optimistic about my fitness level back then. Leading up to the race, my weekly training volume was only 40-50 km spread across three runs. During the first hour of the race I realized it was not enough at all. Here is how my heart rate and pace looked like during the race:

Honestly, I do not know what I was thinking in the first 40 minutes. Running at a 5:00/km pace would be enough to achieve a 3 hours 30 minutes finish time. When I realized I had not trained enough, it was too late and slowing down (having to slow down) and taking walk breaks only prolonged the agony. Here is a breakdown of each kilometer split in relation to my heart rate. The measurements were taken by my Garmin watch.

Pace and heart rate all over the place! The average of all the splits is marked by the black cross.

After the disappointing result, I wanted to train again, and this time more properly. I got a chest strap heart rate monitor to ensure more accurate and timely heart rate measurements. I also wanted to run at an easier pace this time, around 140 bpm. For my first marathon, I was running at 156 bpm during the "easy" runs.

I then signed up for the Madison Marathon on November 12. That meant I had 26 weeks to train. With most marathon training plans spanning 16 to 20 weeks, I had plenty of time. I found a marathon training plan online. After some mile-to-km conversions and rounding up the numbers, I ended up with a previous version of the table below. Although rarely, I had to skip runs or adjust the daily volume. After 26 weeks my training looked like this:

Table legend:
- "e": Easy runs where I tried to keep my heart rate below 136.
- "Long": Typically longer than 20 km and heart rate below 145.
- "Tempo": Between 5:00-5:30/km pace.
- "Interval": Splits of 1 km, 1.25 km, 400 m with 1:1 run:rest.
- "Race": Race tempo, meaning 5:00/km pace.

I think having 6 30+ km long runs in this training phase was crucial. During these runs, I gained a better understanding of my body's cues, e.g. knowing precisely when to drink water, when to take gels, ideal frequency for both... In contrast, I had only one such run for my first marathon.

By the end of my training, I logged a total of 1773 km. Here is how the distribution looks like:

And finally, here is how the 1773 km look like with respect to pace and heart rate.

Half Marathon #2 represents the half marathon race I completed in Seattle. I ran it in 1 hour and 44 minutes, setting a new PB by one minute despite a very hilly course (358 m elevation gain). I placed third in my age group and earned myself a commemorative award. The improvement compared to the first marathon is strikingly evident. It becomes even more evident with the graph below:

![Marathon # 2 splits]({{ site.url }}/assets/marathon_hr_training/marathon2.png)

I finished my second marathon in 3 hours and 25 minutes with an average pace of 4:50/km and average heart rate of 174 bpm. Compared to Half Marathon #2, there is a 0:10/km pace and 10 bpm heart rate improvement despite being twice as long. Seeing this improvement, and the stark difference in the graphs below (top: #2, bottom: #1) motivates me to run more.

Here is what I am planning to do after taking a 2-3 weeks of rest:
- I will ramp up my weekly volume gradually and reach 80 km per week.
- I will do my easy runs at an even easier pace, around 127 bpms.
- I will see how having 1 interval and 1 tempo sessions each week affects my body.
- I will aim for a marathon in Fall 2024 with 2 hours 55 minutes finishing time.
- In the meantime, I will do some strength workouts.

Some time soon, I will also write about my opinions on "The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing" by Philip Maffetone.
