# Blog

Forked from [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter).

Contains basic configuration to get you a site with:

- Sample posts.
- Sample top navigation.
- Sample author sidebar with social links.
- Sample footer links.
- Paginated home page.
- Archive pages for posts grouped by year, category, and tag.
- Sample about page.
- Sample 404 page.
- Site wide search.

Replace sample content with your own and [configure as necessary](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).
