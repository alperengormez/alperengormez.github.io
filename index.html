title: "About Me"

<p>
I am a research scientist at Meta, in the Modern Recommendation Systems - GPU Efficiency team. I received my Ph.D. from University of Illinois Chicago, where I worked on efficient neural network inference and training. More specifically, I have experience in the following areas: early exit networks, pruning, sparsity, quantization, knowledge distillation, semantic segmentation, large language models, mixture of experts and streaming models.

In the past, I had the pleasure of writing about Formula 1 news for damalibayrak.com. Nowadays, I am passionate about running and a little bit of paragliding. I enjoy watching all sorts of sporting events, but in particular I like road bicycle racing. I think correspondence chess is the best type of chess. Beyond these, I try my best to read and travel as much as possible.
