title: "About Me"

<p>
I am a Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Chicago in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. Currently, I am working on the trade-off between the computational cost and the performance of deep learning models. More specifically, I have experience in the following areas: early exit networks, pruning, sparsity, quantization, knowledge distillation, semantic segmentation and large language models.

In the past, I had the pleasure of writing about Formula 1 news for damalibayrak.com. Nowadays, I am passionate about running, triathlon, and a little bit of paragliding. I enjoy watching all sorts of sporting events, but in particular I like snooker. I think correspondence chess is the best type of chess. Beyond these, I try my best to read and travel as much as possible.
