<p>
I am a Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Chicago in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. Currently, I am working on the trade-off between the computational cost and the performance of deep learning models. More specifically, I have experience in the following areas: early exit networks, pruning, sparsity, quantization, knowledge distillation, semantic segmentation and large language models.

Once upon a time, I was writing about Formula 1 news at damalibayrak.com. Nowadays, I am into running and triathlon (and a little bit of paragliding). I enjoy playing correspondence chess.
