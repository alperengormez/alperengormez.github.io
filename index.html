title: "About Me"

<p>
I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Currently, I am working on reducing the computational cost of neural networks while trying to preserve the performance.
</p>

<p>
My research interests are: deep learning, reinforcement learning and their applications.
</p>

<p>
Before coming to UIC, I received my B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey. During my undergraduate study, I had chance to work in ASELSAN as a candidate engineer, with a focus of sonar signal processing. In my exchange semester in Nagoya University, Japan, I got interested in machine learning while working under the supervision of Prof. Kenji Mase.

I am also a passionate chess player, and I enjoy watching Formula&nbsp;1 races. I listen to Anatolian Rock music a lot.
